# E-Commerce Shoe Store

This is an e-commerce store I've built to practice my React skills.

The website is responsive and has some simple cart functionality.

## How to Deploy

1. Download the folder or git clone the repo
2. cd to root directory, i.e. folder called "dot-cards-store"
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm run dev`
5. Access the localhost URL that appears in the terminal
